Hello and welcome to one of my first Python project, done back in highschool. This project is basically emulating tron in a Python terminal.
This project include a HTML presentation about it. So if you want to learn more, just check out the index.html page.

### Disclamer : all the content is in french

To run the project :  just compile and run demo.py, that's it.
